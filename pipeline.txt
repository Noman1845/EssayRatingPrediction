# training data --
# remove useless columns --
# scale the scores --
# train classification model on current data
# extract features from text
# scale the features
# use regression on features to get target
# print performance
# make conclusion 
# test with other models, features and classification
# create the web app

# make regression to get prediction => scaled value
# rollback transform from scaling model to get rounded grade => predicted score
# compare predicted score and domain#_score to get accuracy of the model
